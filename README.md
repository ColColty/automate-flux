# Automate flux

> Extension for specific flux file structure and TypeScript projects !
>
> If you want to handle more things like JavaScript or personalized file structure, you can submit the idea in the issues section or submit a new Pull Request.

This extension aims to generate automatically the files for the flux architecture.

## Usage

Once you create your model and add it to your `index.js` in `Models` folder.

For the moment the required folder architecture is the following :

``` bash
 src
 |- ActionCreators
 |
 |- ActionTypes
 |
 |- Models
 |  |- index.ts             # Where all the models are exported
 |
 |- Sagas
 |  |- RootSagas.ts         #Â Where all the sagas functions are yield to
 |
 |- Reducers
 |  |- RootReducer.ts       # Where the combine reducer set all the reducers
 |
 |- Services
 |  |- index.ts             # Where the api axios instance is created
 |
 |- Store
    |- configureStore.ts    # Where you declare your 'StoreState' interface
```

## What does it generates ?

This extension, once you run the command `automate-flux.generate-flux`. It will generate a file with all the types, action creators, reducers, sagas and also services.

For example:
If we want to create a flux structure for the model called `Example`, we will have the following files in their related folder.

``` bash
ExampleActionType.ts
ExampleActionCreator.ts
ExampleSagas.ts
ExampleReducer.ts
ExampleService.ts
```
